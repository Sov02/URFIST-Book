Contemporary Dominican cinema features a series of realistic portraits and testimonies from society. We note a significant Haitian presence due to the bilateral trading relations, migration, and economic effects between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This dissertation looks at this specific presence to quantify, evaluate and determine if it is a part of the identity in the Dominican cinema. It focuses specifically along the historic relationship between both countries and we are going to evaluate the Haitian sociocultural presence in the Dominican Republic’s feature films. This critical approach will let us know how these two Republics that share the same island, similar history events but different society, culture, economy, religion and arts, will have a direct impact on the Dominican cinema. We will develop a synoptic table with a historical timeline of the island and the Dominican society, culture and the production of feature films that are 70 minutes or more in length, and that are projected in theaters. Then, we will be able to analyze the socio-cultural context of this presence and establish the trajectory of the Dominican cinema since its inception. The Dominican Republic, which is currently developing its cinematic identity, needs to identify the visual elements in common among filmmakers that make a particular difference within Latin American films in order to expand this young industry. Our case study focuses on the drama “Jean Gentil”, written and directed by Laura Amelia Guzmán and Israel Cárdenas. It is about a Haitian man who recently lost his job as a French teacher and begins a desperate job search in Santo Domingo.
